This is the Github for the team, Clever 11. The team has been tasked to build a working emergency ventialtor. 
* The target for the code is an ESP32-DevkitC-V4 by Espressif.


# Install Steps
.5 (Make sure the ESP32 board is installed to your Arduino Enviornment)
1. Install the required libs under the folder "Libraries_required."
2. Compile and Install

# Things Still ToDo (not Exhasutive)
* TODO1. Build display (Make the display outline)
* TODO2. Add display manipulation
* TODO3. Add the temp sensor Variables (These are what the interrupt handler puts data into)
* TODO4. Add sensor reading
* TODO5. Add sensor declariations to the SensorIO.h file (Similar to TODO3)
* TODO6. Copy Sensor Data for Processing
* TODO7. Process sensor data and store.
